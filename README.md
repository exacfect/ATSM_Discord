# Auto Send Message Discord

Auto Send Message Discord is a command-line program written in Python to automate sending messages to a Discord channel or user.

## Tutorial
 * Look the `settings.txt` and `message.txt` files:
  - `settings.txt` to enter the required information:
    - First line: Discord token of your account ([Tutorial](https://github.com/exacfect/ATSM_Discord/blob/639c120aab20fcd1aa002040eb8c1efd2b52c5e8/Assets/tutorial.png)).
    - Second line: ID of the channel you want to send messages to.
    - Third line: Delay time between sending messages (unit: seconds).
    - Fourth line(Optional):Attachments URL (example:https://github.com/exacfect/ATSM_Discord/images.jpg) 

- Edit the `message.txt` file and enter the message content you want to send.
